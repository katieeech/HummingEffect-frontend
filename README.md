## Welcome!

HummingEffect is a fun guessing game app for hummed songs. This game app lets players to choose what songs are included and displayed based on decade. The game is simple. A player (hummer) hums or whistles one of the four songs presented on the screen and other players (guessers) try to guess it correctly. The game is set up to have at least three players and allows players to choose a number of turns to play. The final scoreboard is displayed at the end of the game. HummingEffect can be played with your friends, family, or coworkers!
